<h2><strong>Early prototypes of reservoir pens</strong></h2>



<p>According to Qadi al-Nu’man al-Tamimi (d. 974) in his Kitab al-Majalis wa ‘l-musayarat, the Fatimid caliph Al-Mu’izz li-Din Allah in Arab Egypt demanded a pen that would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen that held ink in a reservoir, allowing it to be held upside-down without leaking.</p>



<p>There is compelling evidence that a working fountain pen was constructed and used during the Renaissance by artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo’s journals contain drawings with cross-sections of what appears to be a reservoir pen that works by both gravity and capillary action. Historians also took note of the fact that the handwriting in the inventor’s surviving journals is of a consistent contrast throughout, rather than exhibiting the characteristic fading pattern typical of a quill pen caused by expending and re-dipping. While no physical item survives, several working models were reconstructed in 2011 by artist Amerigo Bombara that have since been put on display in museums dedicated to Leonardo.</p>



<h2><strong>European reservoir models</strong></h2>



<p>The fountain pen was available in Europe in the 17th century and is shown by contemporary references. In Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae (a 1636 magazine), German inventor Daniel Schwenter described a pen made from two quills. One quill served as a reservoir for ink inside the other quill. The ink was sealed inside the quill with cork. Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point.[4] In 1663 Samuel Pepys referred to a metal pen “to carry ink”.Noted Maryland historian Hester Dorsey Richardson (1862–1933) documented a reference to “three silver fountain pens, worth 15 shillings” in England during the reign of Charles II, c. 1649–1685.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hgxzmn.github.io/Pen/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/img_History.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-663" width="349" height="422"><figcaption><em>Deliciae physico-mathematicae</em>, 1636</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>By the early 18th century such pens were already commonly known as “fountain pens”.Hester Dorsey Richardson also found a 1734 notation made by Robert Morris the elder in the ledger of the expenses of Robert Morris the younger, who was at the time in Philadelphia, for “one fountain pen”.Perhaps the best-known reference, however, is that of Nicholas Bion (1652–1733), whose illustrated description of a “plume sans fin” was published in 1709 in his treatise published in English in 1723 as “The Construction and Principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments”. The earliest datable pen of the form described by Bion is inscribed 1702, while other examples bear French hallmarks as late as the early 19th century.</p>



<h2><strong>First patents</strong></h2>



<p>Progress in developing a reliable pen was slow until the mid-19th century because of an imperfect understanding of the role that air pressure plays in the operation of pens. Furthermore, most inks were highly corrosive and full of sedimentary inclusions. The first English patent for a fountain pen was issued in May 1809 to Frederick Fölsch, with a patent covering (among other things) an improved fountain pen feed issued to Joseph Bramah in September 1809. John Scheffer’s patent of 1819 was the first design to see commercial success, with a number of surviving examples of his “Penographic” known. Another noteworthy pioneer design was John Jacob Parker’s, patented in 1832 – a self-filler with a screw-operated piston.The Romanian inventor Petrache Poenaru received a French patent on May 25, 1827, for the invention of a fountain pen with a barrel made from a large swan quill.</p>

<h2><strong>Mass-manufactured nibs</strong></h2>



<p>In 1828, Josiah Mason improved a cheap and efficient slip-in nib in Birmingham, England, which could be added to a fountain pen and in 1830, with the invention of a new machine, William Joseph Gillott, William Mitchell, and James Stephen Perry devised a way to mass manufacture robust, cheap steel pen nibs (Perry & Co.).This boosted the Birmingham pen trade and by the 1850s, more than half the steel-nib pens manufactured in the world were made in Birmingham. Thousands of skilled craftsmen were employed in the industry.Many new manufacturing techniques were perfected, enabling the city’s factories to mass-produce their pens cheaply and efficiently. These were sold worldwide to many who previously could not afford to write, thus encouraging the development of education and literacy.</p>



<h2><strong>New patents and inventions</strong></h2>



<p>In 1848, American inventor Azel Storrs Lyman patented a pen with “a combined holder and nib”.From the 1850s, there was a steadily accelerating stream of fountain pen patents and pens in production. However, it was only after three key inventions were in place that the fountain pen became a widely popular writing instrument. Those were the iridium-tipped gold nib, hard rubber, and free-flowing ink.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hgxzmn.github.io/Pen/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/US68445.png" alt="" class="wp-image-717" width="272" height="314"><figcaption>M. Klein and Henry W. Wynne received U.S.Patent 68,445 in 1867 for an ink chamber and delivery system in the handle of the fountain pen</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The first fountain pens making use of all these key ingredients appeared in the 1850s. In the 1870s Duncan MacKinnon, a Canadian living in New York City, and Alonzo T. Cross of Providence, Rhode Island, created stylographic pens with a hollow, tubular nib and a wire acting as a valve.Stylographic pens are now used mostly for drafting and technical drawing but were very popular in the decade beginning in 1875. In the 1880s the era of the mass-produced fountain pen finally began. The dominant American producers in this pioneer era were Waterman, of New York City, and Wirt, based in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Waterman soon outstripped Wirt, along with many companies that sprang up to fill the new and growing fountain pen market. Waterman remained the market leader until the early 1920s.</p>



<p>At this time, fountain pens were almost all filled by unscrewing a portion of the hollow barrel or holder and inserting the ink by means of an eyedropper – a slow and messy procedure. Pens also tended to leak inside their caps and at the joint where the barrel opened for filling.Now that the materials’ problems had been overcome and the flow of ink while writing had been regulated, the next problems to be solved were the creation of a simple, convenient self-filler and the problem of leakage. In 1890, W. B. Purvis patented a self-filler. Self-fillers began to arrive around the turn of the century; the most successful of these was probably the Conklin crescent-filler, followed by A. A. Waterman’s twist-filler.The tipping point, however, was the runaway success of Walter A. Sheaffer’s lever-filler, introduced in 1912,paralleled by Parker’s roughly contemporary button-filler.</p>



<h2><strong>Pen leakage</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, many inventors turned their attention to the problem of leakage.Some of the earliest solutions to this problem came in the form of a “safety” pen with a retractable point that allowed the ink reservoir to be corked like a bottle. The most successful of these came from Francis C. Brown of the Caw’s Pen and Ink Co. and from Morris W. Moore of Boston.</p>



<p>In 1898, George Safford Parker released the Parker Jointless, named so because its barrel was single-piece to prevent leakage. The section assembly fit into the pen’s end like a cork stopper; any leaked ink was kept inside the nib.</p>



<p>In 1908, Waterman began marketing a popular safety pen of its own.For pens with non-retractable nibs, the adoption of screw-on caps with inner caps that sealed around the nib by bearing against the front of the section effectively solved the leakage problem (such pens were also marketed as “safety pens”, as with the Parker Jack Knife Safety and the Swan Safety Screw-Cap).</p>



<h2><strong>Further innovation</strong></h2>



<p>In Europe, the German supplies company which came to be known as Pelikan was started in 1838, and they first introduced their pen in 1929.[26] This was based upon the acquisition of patents for solid-ink fountain pens from the factory of Slavoljub Penkala from Croatia (patented 1907, in mass production since 1911), and the patent of the Hungarian Theodor Kovacs for the modern piston filler by 1925.</p>



<p>The decades that followed saw many technological innovations in the manufacture of fountain pens. Celluloid gradually replaced hard rubber, which enabled production in a much wider range of colors and designs.At the same time, manufacturers experimented with new filling systems. The inter-war period saw the introduction of some of the most notable models, such as the Parker Duofold and Vacumatic,Sheaffer’s Lifetime Balance series,and the Pelikan 100.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1919" height="845" src="https://hgxzmn.github.io/Pen/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1920px-Mabie_Todd_SWAN_172-52.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-724"><figcaption>Lever filler pen made of celluloid by Mabie Todd & Co. New York (1927)</figcaption></figure>



<p>During the 1940s and 1950s, fountain pens retained their dominance: early ballpoint pens were expensive, were prone to leaks and had irregular inkflow, while the fountain pen continued to benefit from the combination of mass production and craftsmanship.(Bíró’s patent, and other early patents on ball-point pens often used the term “ball-point fountain pen,” because at the time the ball-point pen was considered a type of fountain pen; that is, a pen that held ink in an enclosed reservoir.)[33] This period saw the launch of innovative models such as the Parker 51, the Aurora 88, the Sheaffer Snorkel, and the Eversharp Skyline and (later) Skyliner, while the Esterbrook J series of lever-fill models with interchangeable steel nibs offered inexpensive reliability to the masses.</p>



<h2><strong>Popular usage</strong></h2>



<p>By the 1960s, refinements in ballpoint pen production gradually ensured its dominance over the fountain pen for casual use.Although cartridge-filler fountain pens are still in common use in France, Italy, Germany, Austria, India, and the United Kingdom, and are widely used by young students in most private schools in England, at least one private school in Scotland, and public elementary schools in Germany[circular reference], a few modern manufacturers (especially Montblanc, Graf von Faber-Castell, and Visconti) now depict the fountain pen as a collectible item or a status symbol, rather than an everyday writing tool.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" src="https://hgxzmn.github.io/Pen/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1280px-Lamy_2000_fountain_pen_EF_semi_hooded_nib.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-725"><figcaption>Lamy 2000 piston filler made of polycarbonate and stainless steel, launched in 1966 and still in production</figcaption></figure>



<p>However, fountain pens continue to have a growing following among many who view them as superior writing instruments due to their relative smoothness and versatility. Retailers continue to sell fountain pens and inks for casual and calligraphic use. Recently, fountain pens have made a resurgence, with many manufacturers of fountain pens saying sales are climbing. This has led to a new wave of casual use fountain pens and custom ink manufacturers, who utilize online stores to easily sell fountain pens to a wider audience.</p>
